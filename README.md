## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br/>
ðŸ“œ Words of Wisdom  
Good data doesnâ€™t just inform â€” it empowers.

Most people chase insights. I chase the *integrity* behind them.  
A flashy dashboard is useless if the pipeline behind it is broken.  
I believe in building solid foundations â€” clean data, reliable systems, and meaningful impact.
