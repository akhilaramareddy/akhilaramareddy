## Hi there 👋
### 📜 Words of Wisdom

**Good data doesn’t just inform — it empowers.**

Most people chase insights. I chase the *integrity* behind them.  
A flashy dashboard is useless if the pipeline behind it is broken.  
I believe in building solid foundations — clean data, reliable systems, and meaningful impact.
